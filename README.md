This project is a proof of concept microservice written in Scala with ZIO. It was written to test if ZIO is a good fit for writing microservices in a larger project.

The microservice demonstrates:

- API endpoints with ZIO HTTP
- Validation with ZIO Prelude
- Json parsing with ZIO Json
- DB access with JDBI

*Versions*

- Scala version: 2.13
- ZIO version: 1.0.12
